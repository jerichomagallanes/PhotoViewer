## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: [repository-link](https://github.com/jerichomagallanes/PhotoViewer.git).
2. Obtain an API key from Pexels: [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/).
3. Navigate to the root folder of the project and open the file named 'app.properties' with a text editor.
4. Replace the placeholder 'PLACE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with your actual API Key.
5. Open the project in Android Studio.
6. Build and run the application on an Android device or emulator.

## üíª Development

### üõ†Ô∏è Build Variants

This project has different build variants to enhance flexibility based on specific requirements. The variants include:

   - Dev: This variant is primarily for developers and does not connect to a real API. It uses Fake Repositories containing dummy responses hardcoded by developers.

   - SIT: This variant is intended to be injected with a different API specifically designed for System Integration Testing (SIT) purposes. It allows for thorough testing and validation of the application's integration with the SIT environment.

   - Prod: This variant uses the actual API intended for the production environment.

   There are 2 types for every variant which are dev and debug (devDebug, devRelease, sitDebug, sitRelease, prodDebug, prodRelease). The dev type is used to compile and debug the application on Android Studio, whereas the release type cannot be compiled and can only be built by generating a signed APK/Bundle using a signing key. Each variant has its own app signing keys, allowing them to be deployed on the Google Play Store independently.
